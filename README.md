CircleOfBoom-Plugin
===================

Plugin for a 'Splosive GameMode


Idea: This minigame consists in a round, rather small circle(r = ~8-13). In this circle players will spawn at random locations.
The game will begin 10sec after this teleport. When the game starts, random amounts of tnt, depending on how long the players have survived, will spawn 10-20 blocks on top of the map, falling at random coordinates. The players goal is to be the last survivor of this masacre.
